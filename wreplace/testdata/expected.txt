A switch statement is a shorter way to write a sequence of if - else statements. It runs the first case whose value is equal to the condition expression.

Python's switch is like the one in C, C++, Java, JavaScript, 
and PHP, except that Python only runs the selected case, 
not all the cases that follow. In effect, the break statement that is 
needed at the end of each case in those languages is provided automatically in Python. 
Another important difference is that Python's switch cases need not be constants, 
and the values involved need not be integers.
